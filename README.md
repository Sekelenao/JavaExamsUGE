# JavaExamsUGE

My solutions for the Java exams at Gustave Eiffel University (UGE) for the computer science program. All JUnit 5 test programs and exams subjects were not written by myself and are available on the university's website.These solutions are neither official nor optimal. This repository only serves as a way for me to revisit some of these complex topics.
